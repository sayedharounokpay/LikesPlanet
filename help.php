<h1>What is CPC?</h1>
<p>CPC is how many points you are willing to spend per like, follow etc. For example if you set CPC to 5 on a Facebook Page then you will spend 5 Points for each Like you receive. The higher your CPC is the faster you will gain likes, followers, etc. The lower your CPC the slower you will gain followers, likes, etc. Make sure to Add Points each time manually when points end for your page.
